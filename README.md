# Jetset Holidays

Jetset Holidays is a React TypeScript application that lets you search for awesome vacation options. 
I built it using hooks like useState, useContext, useEffect, and useRef, so you know it's super modern and efficient and for the styling I have used bootstrap. With Jetset Holidays, you can easily find the perfect holiday that suits your preferences. Just select your desired options from the user-friendly interface, and the app will show you a list of fantastic destinations. You can even track how many adults, children, and kids are going on the trip using the person counter feature. The best part? Kids get a sweet discount at half the price of adults! You can find the source code for Jetset Holidays on my GitHub repository.
Feel free to check it out and have fun exploring the demo by clicking the picture. It's a project I worked on to practice my skills with TypeScript.
